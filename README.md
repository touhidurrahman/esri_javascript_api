At the core of this web map application lies the MapView element, which creates a map view within the designated HTML div with the ID viewDiv. The application begins by loading the necessary JavaScript libraries and CSS stylesheets from the Esri server. The main map object is instantiated with a basemap set to "streets-navigation-vector," providing the underlying map imagery. The initial center coordinates and zoom level are specified, establishing the initial map extent.

The application incorporates several geographic data layers, each represented by a GeoJSONLayer that fetches data from external GeoJSON files. These layers include information about DMA boundaries, transmission lines, deep tube wells, and DMA chambers. Each layer is styled uniquely to visualize different attributes, such as status, type, and diameter. The styling includes various colors, sizes, and symbol types for both polygons and lines, enhancing the visual representation of the data.

To facilitate interaction and analysis, the application integrates several widgets. The LayerList and Legend widgets enable users to toggle layers on and off and view the legend for each layer, respectively. Pop-up templates are defined for each layer, providing detailed information about specific map features when clicked. Widgets like Compass, Locate, Search, Editor, and ScaleBar are added to the interface to assist users in navigation, orientation, searching for specific locations, editing features, and obtaining scale information.
